        "Very popular \"Gyukatsu\" (beef cutlet) restaurant that now runs 6 branches in Tokyo (as of October 2016). Note that Shibuya branches are always very crowded and you should expect to wait for an hour or so, I'd suggest you get there 30-60 minutes prior or go to the other branches (less crowded). The beef cutlet is deep-fried outside very quickly, so it's fairly rare inside. It used to be more cooked and you were to eat it as is, but as they became popular among visitors from overseas, they started serving a stone grill along with the cutlet so that you can cook as you like. I imagine there was an increasing feedback from the customers that the meat was too rare. I actually liked more the way it used to be, but guess it's better now for non-Japanese customers. It's 1,300 JPY (130g of beef) and comes as a combo and the photo abve is 2,100 JPY combo (260g of beef). I'd say 130g would be enough for most people.",

The concept at Tapas Molecular Bar has been created by Chef de Cuisine Kento Ushikubo. Having majored in Art, Chef Kento's unique background inspires his passion for creative gastronomy, presenting \"an art gallery of 14 dishes that stimulates the five senses and the imagination\". He takes guests on a culinary tour - with a visual feast like works of art and with flavours from around the world, using tools and techniques that wouldn't be out of place in science labs or artists' studios. To complement the experience, dishes are carefully paired with fine drinks selected by our restaurant's sommelier or meticulously crafted by our bartender.",
